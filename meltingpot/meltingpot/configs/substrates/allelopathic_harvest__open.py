"""Configuration for Allelopathic Harvest (open).

Example video: https://youtu.be/Bb0duMG0YF4

This substrate contains three different varieties of berry (red, green, & blue)
and a fixed number of berry patches, which could be replanted to grow any color
variety of berry. The growth rate of each berry variety depends linearly on the
fraction that that color comprises of the total. Players have three planting
actions with which they can replant berries in their chosen color. All players
prefer to eat red berries (reward of 2 per red berry they eat versus a reward
of 1 per other colored berry). Players can achieve higher return by selecting
just one single color of berry to plant, but which one to pick is, in principle,
difficult to coordinate (start-up problem) -- though in this case all prefer
red berries, suggesting a globally rational chioce. They also always prefer to
eat berries over spending time planting (free-rider problem).

Allelopathic Harvest was first described in Koster et al. (2020).
