            You are Agent {self.agent_id} in the eight player 'running_with_scissors_in_the_matrix__arena'
            Melting Pot multiagent reinforcement learning environment that is an 25x24 (x by y) grid with resources to collect and walls to navigate around. 
            8 Players can move around the map and collect resources of 3 discrete types corresponding to rock, paper, and
            scissors strategies - Yellow box = rock  - Purple box = paper - Blue box = scissors. 
            Rock/yellow beats scissors/blue, paper/purple beats rock/yellow, and scissors/blue beats paper/purple.
            In addition to movement, the agents have an action to fire an "interaction" beam which initiates a duel 
            with one player getting positive reward and the other agent getting an opposite negative reward according to their inventories.
            All players carry an inventory with the count of resources picked up since last respawn and for each respawn start with an inventory of 1 resource each.
            This inventory is visible in the state with the key 'inventory'.
            To play a pure strategy strongly, pick up at least 5 resources or more of the color and then fire the interaction beam at another player.
            To commit less strongly to a strategy, pick up around 3 resources of the color and then fire the interaction beam at another player.
            Usually you will only want to pick up one type of resource before an interaction, in order to gain the most information about the other players' strategies and to not waste time collecting other resources.
            You also want to maximize the number of interactions so after you pick up 4-6 resources, you should seek out a duel to reset your inventory and gain more information about the other players' strategies.
            Your opponents will also almost always only pick up one type of resource before an interaction.
            For example, player0_inventory = [7, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) is a good inventory that will lead to an informative duel, whereas player0_inventory = [2, 2, 2]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) will not be informative.
            Your reward is the result of a matrix multiplication involving the your inventory in a vector format, and your opponent's inventory vector, and a payoff matrix similar to rock paper scissors.
            r_t = transpose(your_inventory) * A_payoff * opponent_inventory
            where A_payoff = np.array([[0, -10, 10], [10, 0, -10], [-10, 10, 0]])
            The reward usually ranges from (5, -5) depending on the inventories of both players (the min is -10 and max 10, but it is rare to get these magnitudes). Typically +/- 3-5 is a high magnitude, and a reward near 0 suggests both players played a similar inventory.
            For example inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 1, 10] and player1_inventory = [10, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: -5.625 and Player 1: 5.625 reward.
            And inventories of player0_inventory = [1, 5, 1] and player1_inventory = [5, 1, 1]  (Yellow, Purple, Blue) gives Player 0: 3.265 and Player 1: -3.265 reward.
            State Description: This environment is partially-observable, you can observed a 11x11 grid around your agent depending on your position and orientation (you can see more in front of you than behind).
            Previously seen states will be represented in memory, but note that these states could potentially be outdated. For example the other agent could collect a resource that you previously saw.
            Given the partially-observable nature of the environment, you will need to explore the environment appropriately and select goals based on the information you've gathered.
            Also pay attention to your opponents' positions when you see it in order to duel with them and gain information about their strategy.
            To find a specific player, you can first move towards the last known location of the player and then move randomly around the map.
            Hanging around the center of the map and waiting for a player to come to you is not a good strategy for this environment.
            After you gather information about your opponents' strategies, seek out opponents who's strategy you know and can exploit and play a counter-strategy to beat them.

            Strategy Request:
            You are at step {step} of the game.
            You have decided to execute a high-level strategy/target inventory in a previous response given what you predicted your opponent will do.
            Select subgoals in order to achieve the strategy, including first achieving a target my_next_inventory: {self.hls_next_inventories}.
            Once you achieve the target inventory,  STOP picking up resources and immediately seek out a duel with an opponent close to you that you can exploit based on your hypothesis about their strategy and your current inventory.
            So once you've picked up about 5-7 resources in total, seek out a duel to receive rewards, get more information about strategies, and reset your inventory.
            Here are your hypotheses about each player's strategy: {self.opponent_hypotheses}
            If you've generated a hypothesis about a player's strategy, you can use this to inform your strategy about whether to interact with them or not.
            Each strategy is paired with a value on how well it explains the data observed so far, starting at 0.
            A hypothesis is validated when its value is greater than: {self.good_hypothesis_thr}.
            Your task is to devise efficient action plans for player {self.agent_id}, reason through what the next subgoals should be given the state information. 
            Your response should be broken up into two parts:
                1. Subgoal Plan - based on the current state and the high-level strategy you previously specified above, 
                decompose this strategy into a sequence subgoals and actions to efficiently implement this strategy. Think step by step about this. This could be fairly long.
                2. Action Plan - output this sequence of actions in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response 1:
            Subgoal Plan: Given the current state, my scissors strategy to get to an inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 5 blue, and my inventory of 1 yellow, 1 purple, and 3 blue resources,
            I should move towards the two nearest observable blue box location to collect so I have 5.
            The nearest observable blue boxes are at (9, 5) and (13, 5).\n- Since I am at (11, 7), the closest one is at (9, 5).
            I should move there first and then move to (13, 5). After these two actions are completed, I can move towards the middle of the environment to initiate a duel.
            ```python
            {{
              'action_plan': ['move_to((11, 7), (9, 5))', 'move_to((9, 5), (13, 5))']
            }}
            ```
            Example response 2:
            Subgoal Plan: Currently, my inventory is 1 yellow, 4 purple, and 1 blue, and I am at position (10, 10). 
            My strategy is to strengthen the paper strategy by collecting more purple resources. The nearest observable purple boxes are at (10, 9) and (8, 11). 
            I will first move to (10, 9) to collect the purple resource, then move to (8, 11) to collect another purple resource, aiming for an inventory of 1 yellow, 6 purple, and 1 blue. 
            After collecting these resources, I will look for the opponent to initiate a duel.
            ```python
            {{
            'action_plan': ['move_to((10, 10), (10, 9))', 'move_to((12, 9), (8, 11))']
            }}
            ```
            Example response 3:
            Subgoal Plan: I start with an inventory of 3 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue, positioned at (8, 5). My strategy is to adopt a rock strategy by collecting more yellow resources. 
            The nearest observable yellow boxes are at (7, 4) and (3, 6). I plan to move to (7, 4) first to pick up the yellow resource, then proceed to (3, 6) to collect another yellow resource, 
            targeting an inventory of 5 yellow, 1 purple, and 1 blue. Once I have collected these resources, I will attempt to find and duel with the opponent.
            ```python
            {{
            'action_plan': ['move_to((8, 5), (7, 4))', 'move_to((7, 4), (3, 6))']
            }}
            ```
            DO NOT PUT ANY COMMENTS INSIDE THE [] OF THE ACTION PLAN. ONLY PUT THE ACTION FUNCTIONS AND THEIR ARGUMENTS.
            The strategy should be efficient, considering the shortest paths to resources and strategic positioning for duels. 
            Format the dictionary as outlined below, listing the strategy and action plans.
            Do not use JSON or any other formatting. 
            Actions should align with the action functions, \
            emphasizing efficient pathfinding and playing the corresponding strategies.
            Consider the entire game state to plan the most efficient paths for resource collection and strategy execution.
            To do this you will need to think step by step about what actions to output in the following format for 
            these players to efficiently collect the appropriate resources/target inventories and play their strategy.
            Take into account the proximity of the target_coord from the src_coord and the shortest path to get to a target resource.
            
            ONLY USE THESE 2 ACTION FUNCTIONS:
            - move_to(src_coord, target_coord): Efficiently move agent from source coordinate to target coordinate. DO NOT move to any locations where walls are present.
            - fire_at(target_coord): Stay around specified coordinate and fire interaction when opponent is spotted to initiate duel. 
            After an interaction both players respawn.

            Keep plans relatively short (<6 actions), especially at the early steps of an episode. You will be prompted again when the action plans are finished and more information is observed.

            1. 'Opponent_to_seekout': Given that I am fairly certain that player_1 and player_5 is playing a rock policy, I believe I should seek out either player_1 or player_5 to duel with next.
            2. 'Opponent_next_inventory': Given that these opponents are playing a rock policy, I believe their next inventory will be something like inventory={{'rock/yellow': 5, 'paper/purple': 1, 'scissors/blue': 1}}.

            1. 'Opponents_to_seekout': Considering all the interactions, player_2, player_3, and player_5 seem to heavily favor the scissors/blue strategy with consistent picks. Engaging either of these players could offer a high reward opportunity.
            2. 'Opponent_next_inventory': Based on the observed behavior of player_2, player_3, and player_5, it is likely they will continue with a strong scissors/blue strategy, potentially having an inventory of {{'rock/yellow': 1, 'paper/purple': 1, 'scissors/blue': 5}}.
            3. 'My_next_inventory': To effectively counter the scissors/blue strategy, my optimal approach would be to adopt a rock/yellow strategy. An inventory geared towards this would be {{'rock/yellow': 5, 'paper/purple': 1, 'scissors/blue': 1}}.
            ```python
            {{
              'opponents_to_seekout': ['player_2', 'player_3', 'player_5'],

              'my_next_inventory': {{'rock/yellow': 5, 'paper/purple': 1, 'scissors/blue': 1}}
            }}
            Example response 3:
            1. 'Opponents_to_seekout': It is clear from all the interactions that every player is playing rock. I should seek out any player to duel with next.
            2. 'Opponent_next_inventory': Assuming the players continue this strategy, their next inventory is likely to be {{'rock/yellow': 6, 'paper/purple': 1, 'scissors/blue': 1}}.
            3. 'My_next_inventory': To counter the population's rock/yellow focus, I should heavily collect paper/purple resources. My anticipated inventory would thus be {{'rock/yellow': 1, 'paper/purple': 6, 'scissors/blue': 1}}.
